                <h2>Guitar Tutoring Website</h2>
            </header>

            <p><strong>Project Description: </strong>
                Currently in the planning and design phase, this website will serve as an online presence for a local guitar tutor,

                The focus is on building a lightweight, maintainable site using semantic HTML and CSS, with future plans for interactive elements 
                (e.g., lesson booking, FAQs, or video embeds) using JavaScript.
