            <p>
                My name is Kirill Shabanov. I am a third-year Computer Science student at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I'm drawn to systems, the ones we build, the ones we live in, and the ones we're only beginning to understand. 
                To me, code isn't just a tool. It's a way of shaping possibility and giving structure to new ideas. 
                I'm not just here to write software. I want to help build what comes next.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm fascinated by the space where theory meets reality, where abstract logic becomes usable technology. 
                Whether I'm crafting internal tools, refining backend systems, or shaping user-facing features, 
                I bring clarity, precision, and purpose to everything I build.
            </p>
            <p>
                I build to give ideas weight. I learn to bring the future within reach. 
                I code because inside every line of logic is a chance to do something that matters.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Below, you'll find a glimpse of the kind of developer I am and the kind of person I'm becoming.

                <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
            </header>
                <p>
                    I'm currently developing a 2D arcade-style game for the Atari ST, called <em>Snake Frenzy</em>, written in C and 
                    optimized with Motorola 68K Assembly. It's a deep dive into low-level systems and performance optimization, 
                    pushing me to write efficient, hardware-aware code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In parallel, I'm building client-facing websites using semantic HTML, with plans for responsive CSS and JavaScript integration. 
                    These projects challenge me to deliver clean, maintainable code that solves real problems for real users.
                </p>
                <p>I'm also deepening my backend knowledge, exploring APIs, databases, and scalable architectures. 
                    Revisiting fundamentals like data structures and design principles continues to sharpen my thinking and expand my capabilities.

                <h2>My Development Philosophy</h2>
            </header>
                <p>I don't just want to write code. I want to make the improbable real. To me, programming isn't just syntax. 
                    It's a way to carve clarity from complexity. It's how theory becomes impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm drawn to the edge, where performance matters, where precision is unforgiving, where each decision 
                    ripples across the system. That's where I feel most alive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe good code doesn't just run. It endures. It adapts. It carries clarity across complexity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every project is a step toward mastery. I aim to be the kind of developer who doesn't just follow 
                    best practices but helps define them through discipline, purpose, and imagination.
                </p>

                <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
            </header>
                <p>
                    Outside of programming, I explore the deeper questions, the kind asked in physics, systems theory, 
                    and the uncertain space between chaos and order. I study how structure emerges from complexity and 
                    how small changes can reshape outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm deeply curious about emerging technologies that could redefine how we live, build, and think. 
                    I believe the future isn't something we inherit. It's something we shape, one insight at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also fascinated by the intersection of logic and creativity, where code becomes design and function becomes form. 
                    In that space, I find both challenge and inspiration.
                </p>
